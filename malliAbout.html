    <p class="pet-description"> Malli's tale unfolds with heartbreak after she was found abandoned in a cardboard box on the streets. 
      She had been involved in a terrible accident that had damaged her forelimb beyond repair, and sadly, she would require amputation surgery. Having suffered so much for one so young, once safe under our care and having undergone lifesaving surgery, we were devastated when she fell sick with the potentially deadly disease: parvo. Thankfully, this sweet wee soul had something of a warrior spirit within her, and after a bravely fought battle with abandonment, loneliness, pain, and disease, she came through it all to emerge victorious!

      <br><br>
         Now a confident tripawd and requiring no special care, Malli is dancing her way gracefully through life, but we donâ€™t want her to do it alone. If you were to welcome this little angel into your home, you would experience all the regular joy of pet parenting, plus the warm, fuzzy feeling that only adopting a rescued,
          differently-abled pet, can ever give. So, what are you waiting for? <br><br>
          All animals adopted from HAS are or will be sterilised for free at the ABC and Rescue Centre. It is mandatory and entirely free of cost for the adopter. Malli will be sterilised at the appropriate time.</p>
